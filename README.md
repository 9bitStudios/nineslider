# Nineslider

A simple slider/rotator. It is available in a vanilla JavaScript version, as a [jQuery](https://jquery.com) plugin, a [React](https://reactjs.org) application, or as a [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org) component. It is intentionally kept very simple with minimal code so that it can be built upon with additional styling or code...

For the React version, which is written in ES6 you will have to build the slider and application using [webpack](https://webpack.js.org). So you will need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed. In the /react directory you will first need to run... 

```
$ npm install
```

to install dependencies. After that finishes you will need to run...

```
$ webpack
```

to watch the files for any changes you make.
